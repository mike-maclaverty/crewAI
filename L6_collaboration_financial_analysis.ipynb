      "1. Long-Term Investment Strategy: For investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, consider buying and holding AAPL stock for potential capital appreciation over time.

Day Trading Strategy: For investors with a moderate risk tolerance and a preference for day trading, consider short-term trading opportunities in AAPL stock based on technical analysis, market trends, and intraday price movements.
